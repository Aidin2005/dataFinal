### **1. Introduction**

Kyrgyzstan, a Central Asian country, has experienced significant urbanization and economic development in recent years. The real estate market in its capital, Bishkek, reflects these changes, with varying property prices influenced by factors such as location, size, and building type. This project aims to analyze a dataset of real estate listings to uncover key trends and predictors of property prices. The dataset was chosen for its relevance to understanding the dynamics of Kyrgyzstan's housing market and its potential to inform buyers, sellers, and policymakers.

The dataset used in this analysis contains real estate listings from Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. It includes the following variables:

- **Price (`price`)**: The listing price of the property.
- **Area (`square`)**: The size of the property in square meters.
- **Price per square meter (`m2_price`)**: Calculated as `price / square`.
- **Number of Rooms (`rooms`)**: The number of rooms in the property.
- **District(`district`)**: The administrative district where the property is located.
- **Micro District (`micro_district`)**: 
- **Building Age (`building_age`)**: The age of the building in years.
- **Building Type (`building_type`)**: The construction material (e.g., brick, panel, monolithic).
- **Floor (`floor`)**: The floor number of the property.
- **Floors (`floors`)**: The total number of floors in the building.
- **Condition**: The condition of the property (e.g., renovated, good).
- **Floor to floors ratio (`floor_to_floors`)**: The ratio of the floor number to the total number of floors.
- **Is good floor (`is_good_floor`)**: A binary variable indicating if the property is on a desirable floor (e.g., not ground or top floor).
The dataset was sourced from publicly available real estate listings and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers.

which is essential for analyzing trends in the real estate market and for building accurate predictive models.

### **3. Data Analysis**

#### **Descriptive Statistics**
- **Price**: Mean = 72,511, Std. Dev. = 36,451, Min = 9,500, Max = 296,000.
- **Area**: Mean = 71.5 m¬≤, Std. Dev. = 34.2, Min = 10, Max = 347.
- **Price/m¬≤**: Mean = 1026.6, Std. Dev. = 195.1, Min = 494, Max = 1,566.
- **Building Age**: Mean = 8.9 years, Std. Dev. = 47.02, Min = 0, Max = 75.

#### **Correlation Analysis**
- Strong correlation between:
  - **Price** and **Square** ‚Üí `r = 0.90`
  - **Price** and **Price/m¬≤** ‚Üí `r = 0.27`


- Weak correlation :
  - **Price** and **Building age** ‚Üí `r = -0.02`
  - **Square** and **Building age** ‚Üí `r = -0.04`
  - **Square** and **price/m2** ‚Üí `r = -0.13`
  - **Building age** and **Price/m¬≤** ‚Üí `r = 0.05`

# More effectively model which predicts price as much as possible 
###  Gradient Boosting Regressor Results
- **R¬≤ = 0.997**: The model explains **99.7%** of the variance in apartment price.
- **MSE = 3,391,739**: The average squared error between predicted and actual prices is relatively low, indicating **high prediction accuracy**.

---

### üîç Feature Importance
**Significant predictors:**
- `square`, `rooms`, `district`, `micro_district`, `condition`, `building_type`, `building_age`, `floor_to_floors`, `is_good_floor`.

**Non-significant predictors:**
- *None.* All selected features contribute meaningfully to predicting the price.

---

### üß™ Hypothesis Testing
- **Building Type 1 vs 2**  
  ‚Üí There is a statistically **significant difference** in prices based on building type (**p < 0.001**).

- **1st Floor vs 5th Floor**  
  ‚Üí Apartment prices differ **significantly** depending on the floor (**p ‚âà 0.0006**).

---
### Interpretation:

- The analysis confirms that property size is the most critical factor influencing prices.
- Other factors, such as location (district) and building type, also play significant roles.
- The weak correlation of building age with price suggests it has minimal impact on valuation.

This section should combine statistical insights with visual evidence to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.

### Goal
- Building a machine learning model to effectively predict prices based on relatively recent data and verifying that the apartment price is appropriate.
